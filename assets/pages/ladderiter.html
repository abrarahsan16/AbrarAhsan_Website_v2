              <a href="../img/portfolio/ladder iterative/BV01_CapstoneFinalReport.pdf">The final report can be found
                here! Further details are listed below.</a>
            </div>
            <!--<div class="col-lg-8 portfolio-info">-->
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
              Load flow is the simulation of a static power system to determine the behaviour of the installed network
              as well as for planning future networks or expansions. It helps in predicting the power flow on the
              transmission and distribution line for static loads. This is useful for future development projects. As
              projects normally are planned 10 or more years ahead of time, designers need to be able to quickly run
              simulations and design systems accurately. As such, a quick, robust and accurate operation of these
              simulations have been a research topic for decadces.
            </p>
            <p>While multiple methods exist, such as Newton-Raphson, not every method is ideal for distribution systems.
              As such, an iterative algorithm is used instead.</p>
            <p>In this project, Python was used to implemented the ladder-iterative algorithm to calculate load-flow
              solutions for various radial distribution systems. The software takes an excel as an input, parses to get
              the needed input in order to run calculations and presenting the output in an excel file after
              convergence. </p>
            <h3>What is a Distribution System?</h3>
            <p>A power distribution system is the final stage in delivering electrical power from multiple generation
              sources, through the transmission system and finally to the individual customers, from high to low
              voltages. Voltages from the generation are high voltages, whereas the voltage needed by customer needs to
              be low voltage, as such the high voltages are delivered to substations, which are located closer to the
              customers, and stepped down via transformers to utilization voltage level. Typically, a substation can
              deliver power to multiple customers through the distribution system.</p>
            <h4>Radial Distribution Systems</h4>
            <p>There are three basic types of distribution system design</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Radial</li>
              <li>Ring</li>
              <li>Network</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our algorithm is designed to work with radial distribution systems.</p>
            <p>A radial distribution system originates from a single source, which is a substation or a
              feed distributor, and spreads out towards the customers or loads. There is a main branch which
              is the longest line, which can have branches followed by sub-branches. The radial structure guarantees
              that there will be no circular connection in the network and each bus is connected to the
              source via one path only. This is the simplest configuration; however, it is also the least reliable. This
              is primarily used in areas which are sparsely populated. The main advantage a
              radial network provides is that due to its simple configuration, the construction cost is also much
              lower.</p>

            <h3>Power Flow Analysis Using Ladder-Iterative Algorithm</h3>
            <p>Power flow analysis is done to obtain the voltage magnitude, power losses, as well as the power flow in
              the system.</p>
            <h4>Backward & Forward Sweep Method</h4>
            <p>
              The backward and forward sweep method is the core part of the algorithm. It is solved
              iteratively, calculating voltage and current values at each bus, which is further used to find the
              power flow, loss, and injection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The forward sweep calculates the voltage drop for each bus in the radial system. The
              source voltage is considered as 1 per-unit, or the actual rated voltage in V, and the following
              buses are calculated using updated current values.
            </p>
            <p>$$V_{(k+1)}=V_k-Z_{(k, k+1)}I_{(k, k+1)}$$</p>
            <p>
              The backward sweep calculates the current flow between buses in the radial system. The
              voltages calculated during the forward sweep are used. It starts from the last bus and moves
              towards the source bus.
            </p>
            <p>$$I_{k+1}=\left(\frac{S_{k+1}}{V_{k+1}}\right)^\ast=I_{k,\ k+1}$$</p>
            <p>$$I_{k-1,k}=\ I_k+I_{k,\ k+1}$$</p>
            <p>The current is calculated across each bus, along with load currents, which are then added to account for
              it's draw.</p>
            <p>Once the backward sweep is complete, the forward sweep is run again, which would result in different
              voltage values as the current values have changed. This process will run recursively until voltage
              convergence is reached.</p>
            <h4>Power Loss</h4>
            <p>
              Power is lost during the distribution stage due to the lineâ€™s internal impedance.
            </p>
            <p>$$S_{{loss}_{km}}=V_k\left[\frac{V_k-V_m}{Z_{km}}\right]^\ast\ +\
              V_m\left[\frac{V_m-V_k}{Z_{km}}\right]^\ast$$</p>
            <p>$$S_{{Total\ loss}_{km}}=\ \sum_{\forall\ \left\{k,\ m\right\}} S_{{loss}_{km}}$$</p>

            <h4>Power Injection</h4>
            <p>
              Power is delivered to each bus via the transmission line. The current flow is calculated
              by accounting for the voltage difference between the two buses and then dividing by the line
              impedance. As a single bus can be connected to multiple buses, all these currents must be added
              to together and finally multiplied by the voltage of the bus to find the power injected into it.
            </p>
            <p>$$S_{{injection}_k}=V_k\sum_{\forall\ \left\{k,\ m\right\}}\left[\frac{V_k-V_m}{Z_{km}}\right]^\ast$$</p>
            <h4>Power Flow</h4>
            <p>
              The final objective is to find the power flow. The power flow is calculated by removing
              the line loss and the load loss from the power injection.
            </p>
            <p>$$P_{k+1}=\ P_k-P_{loss,\ k}-P_{load,k+1}$$</p>
            <p>$$Q_{k+1}=\ Q_k-Q_{loss,\ k}-Q_{load,k+1}$$</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              The design of the software went through multiple iterations to find the most optimized and efficient, as
              well as most user-friendly implementation of the system. The software has 3 main parts, the data parser,
              calculation engine and the graphical user interface.
            </p>
            <p>An overview of each section is detailed below.
              For further details, refer to the final report.
            </p>
            <div class="col-lg-5">
              <h4>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h4>
              <p>
                The Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows the user to interact with the software. The user
                can select the input data file, the tolerance value they want to set for the calculations, view error
                prompts when problems are encountered and preview their output data.
              </p>
              <div class="text-center">

                <figcaption><u>Input Window GUI</u></figcaption>
              </div>
              <h4>Data Parser</h4>
              <p>The Data Parser consists of multiple functions, but the primary objective is to extract the
                relevant information of the input Excel file from the path provided by the GUI. To accomplish
                this, the development made use of multiple Python libraries, but the most important ones are
                Pandas and NumPy, both very powerful data manipulation tools. These libraries allow the data
                to be extracted efficiently without disrupting the worksheet structure of Excel. Once extracted,
                multiple verification checks are run to ensure that the data contains the necessary information to
                allow the load-flow calculations to begin.
              </p>
              <h4>Calculation Engine</h4>
              <p>The design and implementation of the calculation engine is the most important part of
                this project. The calculation engine acts as the brain of the entire system, taking the input data
                from the data parser and the tolerance value provided by the user, and calculating the voltages,
                current, power loss, injection, and flow. </p>
              <p>After the initialization, the calculation engine follows Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws and employs the
                forward and backward sweep approach. The forward sweep calculates the voltages on each bus,
                whereas the backward sweep calculates the current using the updated voltage values if the voltage
                convergence fails. The forward and backward sweep method is related to the Ladder Network
                Theory. To determine voltage convergence, the value of the final bus is compared against the
                value from the previous iteration. Convergence happens when the error tolerance is satisfied.
                Once all the voltages and current has been calculated, it is passed to the power calculations before
                returning to the Data Parser for exporting.</p>

            <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>The method calculates the voltage and current during the forward and backward sweeps and
              calculates the power flow at the end of the process to find load-flow of the distribution system.
              The voltage magnitudes for each node are calculated in the forward sweep and reaches voltage
              convergence fast. The system was tested for the IEEE 33-bus as well as the IEEE 69-bus. It was
              found that for both systems, the algorithm can reach fast convergence.
